This project identifies State and gives its corresponding capital and its Latitude and Longitude.
This project uses a JSON file which have all the data pre-saved along with its abbreviation and whenever a request is made, JS grabs the data from the file and displays it.
I made this project while I was brushing up mmy concept on JS.
